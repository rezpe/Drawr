This library permits you to build a canvas where users can draw

How to use:

You use function createDrawr to create a jquery object containing the canvas
$drawr = createDrawr(600,600).appendTo("body")

Then you can set css and attr like in normal jquery objects
$drawr.css({position:"absolute",left:0,top:0})

Events:

There are 3 events that are triggered

start: When you start drawing (mouse Down)
drawing: While you are drawing (mouse Move)
endpath: When you end drawing (mouse Up)

For example:

$drawr.bind("endpath",function(evt,x,y){
        points = $(this).data("list")
        createShape(points)
})


Data:

Using the key "list", one can access the array of points of drawn path
points = $(this).data("list")
